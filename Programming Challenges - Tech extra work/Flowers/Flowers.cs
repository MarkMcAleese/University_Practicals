/* Problem
You and your K-1 friends want to buy N flowers. Flower number i has cost ci.
Unfortunately the seller does not like a customer to buy a lot of flowers, 
so he tries to change the price of flowers for customer who had bought flowers 
before. More precisely if a customer has already bought x flowers, he should pay
 (x+1)*ci dollars to buy flower number i.

You and your K-1 friends want to buy all N flowers in such a way that you spend
the least amount of money possible. You can buy the flowers in any order.

Input:

The first line of input contains two integers N and K (K <= N) next line 
contains N positive integers c1,c2,â€¦,cN respectively.

Output:

Print the minimum amount of money you (and your friends) have to pay in order to
buy all N flowers.
